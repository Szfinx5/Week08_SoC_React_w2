PLAN:
 x - set up the file structure so we've got a basic idea of what our app needs to look like
 - practice fetch quickly with the API key?

 - once we have a working fetch function, revisit the App plan on Miro

 -------









USEFUL BITS OF CODE:

/* - handleClick event 

function handleClick(event) {
  console.log(event);
  if (event.shiftKey === true) {
    button.innerText = "Nailed it!"
  } else { button.innerText = "Click me"
  };
};

*/
